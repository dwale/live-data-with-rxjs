      <h2>Short Polling</h2>

      <h5>
        The client sends a request to a server and it gets a response from the
        server which could be either be an empty response or probably a json
        response . In short polling this request is made in intervals

      <h2>Long Polling</h2>

      <h5>
        The client makes a request to a resource which is usually a server , if
        there is data for the server to return , it is returned and the
        connection is closed but if thereâ€™s no data , it still keeps the
        connection open until there is data available for it to send
      </h5>

      <h2>Web Sockets</h2>

      <h5>
        Its a bit similar to long polling in a sense that a connection is always
        open between the client and the resource but once that connection is
        setup the Server passes messages to the client by sending data events to
        the client, the communication here is also bi-directional as the client
        can also send messages to the resource
